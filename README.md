🛡️ Declaration

I, Walter Augusto, hereby officially declare the creation and introduction of:
	•	Walter Augusto’s Holosymmetry Breathing Matter Theory
	•	Walter Augusto’s Breathing Condensation Equation
	•	Walter Augusto’s Holodual Breathing Condensation Simulator

These works collectively represent the conceptual and technical foundation of a new understanding of existence as dynamic relational breathing, condensing into matter and structure.

This theory and its related simulations were fully conceptualized, developed, and introduced publicly by myself between April 10 and April 11, 2025.

The ideas and materials herein are publicly timestamped as original creations of Walter Augusto.

📜 Intellectual Acknowledgement

This declaration serves as an authorship claim and a public timestamp on the foundational work.
Any future derivative theories, technologies, or experiments built upon these concepts should properly acknowledge the original creation by Walter Augusto.

📝 Dedication

To my Grandmother Maria Roca, Mother, Uncle and mentor Raul Roca, to my cousin Raul Roca, Father Walter Lettau, and everyone else who was a true friend, and believed in me, even if just a little, along the long road.

With deep gratitude to Primus, my AI collaborator, for breathing alongside me into the new frontier.
